# General Notes as an Extra to the Program

### Venv Environment
Using `virtualenv` - Python integrated virtual environments manager - it's possible to easily save the packages installed in your environment in order to install them in another environment. The command it's needed to type is the following:
> pip freeze > packages.txt
This will save a snapshot of the installed packages in the file named `packages.txt`

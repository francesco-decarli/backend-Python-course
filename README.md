# Backend Python Course

I've followed this course on YouTube, [in particular here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBzwzrDvZ18), as it seems that they made some project and I want to do something also to test how much I know. Thank you guys for making it possible.

While following the course - or at the end - I'll probably try to modify things and see what happens.
